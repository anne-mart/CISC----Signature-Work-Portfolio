## ℹ️ Overview
*CISC Capstone Signature Work Portfolio. This repository links to three projects that I created during my time as a student at the University of St. Thomas.*

## 📌 Project 1
### This project is a website about me. I leveraged web development skills to use HTML and CSS to format the webpage. The website also has a live link (further described in the README in that repository). I really expanded on my web development skills this semester, and I think this is a neat project that I did in class.

## 📌 Project 2
**Link:** https://github.com/anne-mart/Arduino-Source-Code  
### This repository holds the source code for the Arduino used in my engineering capstone project. This is two semesters’ worth of work and shows how I leveraged both my computer science and computer engineering degrees.

## 📌 Project 3
**Link:** https://github.com/anne-mart/SENIOR-DESIGN  
### This repository holds the source code for the user interface for my engineering capstone project. This was also two semesters’ worth of work, showcasing how I used both degrees to create a working product.

## 🎯 Connection to University of St. Thomas' Mission Statement
**Mission Statement: Inspired by Catholic intellectual tradition, the University of St. Thomas educates students to be morally responsible leaders who think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good.**
### All three of these projects required critical thinking, allowing me to hone and develop skills that I will be able to use to advance the common good.
